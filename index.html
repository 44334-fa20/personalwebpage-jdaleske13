    <h1>Getting to Know Daleske</h1>
    <p>Hello everybody, my name is Jacob Daleske. I am currently a student at Northwest Missouri State University. I am majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems, with a minor in Digital Media. I am currently a Sophomore at NWMSU, and I have taken many programming classes over the past two years. You may also see me in Data Structures and Pre-Calculus. I commute every day from Bedford, Iowa to Northwest. Northwest is not the first college I have been to, but it is the college I have to devoted the most time to. Provided below are the other colleges I have been to along with the websites to check them out.</p>

    <h2>Daleske's Uneventful Summer</h2>
    <p>This summer was actually super boring for me. Due to COVID-19, I was under quarantine a lot because my anxiety would not let me be in big crowds. I also had a shoulder surgery right before summer so I was laid up on the couch for about a month. Anyway, after my shoulder surgery, when COVID got really big, I ended up contracting COVID for the first time. COVID is not fun to have, <b>please wear your masks and stay six feet apart.</b> I showed symptoms for COVID for almsot 3 weeks the first time and it was an uphil better getting better. After I was no longer sick, I applied to work at Pizza Hut in Clarinda. I have been there almost 3 months and I love it there. Sadly though, I had a coworker who contracted COVID and was asymptomatic.This led to the second time that I contracted COVID. This leads me to know where I was finally cleared and able to start at Northwest.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>For anybody who is wondering, outside of school, I am a giant car buff. I am a part time mechanic and spent a lot of time doing bodywork and repairing old broken down vehicles. It is one of the only things that tends to help my severe anxiety. As of right now, I have worked on dozens of vehicles (all makes and models) and I have started to do retromods on some older vehicles. Provided below are two vehicles that I have personally rebuilt or are in the process of rebuilding. All pictures provided are not mine, they are just visual aids to show the vehicles.</p>
